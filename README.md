# cs35l-qtr-project-fall2024

This project is a web app called "Rumeez" and was developed for the purpose of helping UCLA students more easily find room mates throughout their time in undergrad. The project uses mongoDB for its backend, and react for its frontend. The frontend was developed using react boostrap and CSS interface design and setup. The backend was housed on an AWS server to keep the application running throughout all times of development and use. However, due to the cost of housing anything on AWS, the server was deactivated after the class ended. 

A note about this project: The group agreed to pivot frontend operations, using react bootstrap to replace the originally hard-coded frontend in javascript. This pivot led to the creation of two front end files "Rumeez" and "Rumeez_2". The final project consists only of folders "Rumeez_backend" and "Rumeez_2".
